In this question, we are supposed to find the sum of the even Fibonacci numbers which do not exceed
four million. Each term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. The
first two elements of the sequence are 1 and 2.

``` python
def fibonacci():
    # initializing the first 2 terms
    x, y = 1, 2
    # num holds the latest number in the generated sequence and check if it's
    # under four million.
    num=0
    result=0

    while num<4000000:
        # the latest number in the sequence is stored in num, x and y are updated
        num=x+y
        x=y
        y=num
        # check if num is even
        if num%2==0:
            result=num+result

    return result

result=fibonacci()
print(result)
```
